# Bookmarklets
A collection of Bookmarklets, tools to do predefined actions on the web.

What is a bookmarklet:
- A string of javascript code that injected in a browser page does predefined action.

How to use:
- Open your bookmark manager.
- Add a bookmark.
- Paste the code in the url field.
- Go on the page the bookmarklet is made for (if it's page-specific).
- Launch the bookmarklet as a common bookmark.

  On mobile:
- Same as Laptop, but only calling the bookmark doesn't work, you should type the first letters of the bookmark until the browser suggest the bookmark, click on the auto-completion and the bookmarklet is launched.

- These were done to work on laptop, but if they are used I'll try to improve them.

What is in this repo:

- Discogs_list_text_in_new_window.txt: A simple tool to export a Discogs list in plain text format, It opens in a new tab the discogs list you are viewing.

- Youtube_playlist_creator_from_discogs_list.txt - Open in a new tab a youtube playlist from a discogs list. (The same videos of the list itself but sometimes the embedded youtube player on                  discogs fails)

- Midi_Monitor.txt - A super tiny MIDI monitor, it asks you permission to connect a midi device, after consent it opens a little window, with channel number and velocity only on Note on event               to avoid double messages.
